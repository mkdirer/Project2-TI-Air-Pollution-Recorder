# Air Pollution Recorder
This is an advanced web app for collecting and analyzing air pollution data using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, IndexedDB, PHP, and MongoDB. Users can enter and view data offline, or register and log in to automatically transfer data from their local browser database to the server. The app validates air pollution data entered by the user, including the air quality index, type of pollutant, location, and date. User sessions are managed using SESSION and sessionStorage. Data is displayed in charts using <canvas> and JavaScript. The app is W3C validated and follows HTML5 and CSS3 standards. Currently, the app cannot be deployed on IBM using MongoDB.
